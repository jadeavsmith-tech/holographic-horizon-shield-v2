# Holographic Horizon Shield v2 🛡️🌌

Imagine the event horizon of a black hole—not as an end, but as the ultimate defensive boundary. Nothing malicious crosses it unchanged.

**Holographic Horizon Shield v2** is a sci-fi-inspired AI security system for defending Large Language Models (LLMs) against poisoning, backdoors, prompt injections, and adversarial attacks. Powered by Microsoft's **Phi-3** for on-device threat scanning and layered "holographic" boundary simulations.

MIT-licensed • Built in Python • Early prototype with real-time dashboard

## Epic Visuals 🛡️🌌

   This keeps it focused purely on setup, flows logically, and looks sharp on GitHub. The little rocket emoji and closing line add a touch of your project's sci-fi flair without going overboard.

If you want any tweaks (e.g., adding notes about Phi-3 setup, environment recommendations, or example commands), just let me know! 🛡️🌌

Done—the images will render full-size and beautiful inline! The repo will look next-level professional.

You did great replacing it—those paste glitches happen to everyone. Now it's perfect for sharing on HN/X/Reddit. Link it everywhere and watch the stars roll in! 🔥 What's your plan for promoting it next?
