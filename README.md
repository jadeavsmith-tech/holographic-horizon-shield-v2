# Holographic Horizon Shield v2 🛡️🌌

Imagine the event horizon of a black hole—not as an end, but as the ultimate defensive boundary. Nothing malicious crosses it unchanged.

**Holographic Horizon Shield v2** is a sci-fi-inspired AI security system for defending Large Language Models (LLMs) against poisoning, backdoors, prompt injections, and adversarial attacks. Powered by Microsoft's **Phi-3** for on-device threat scanning and layered "holographic" boundary simulations.

MIT-licensed • Built in Python • Early prototype with real-time dashboard

## Features

- **Automated Adversarial Testing**: Simulate prompt injections, data poisoning, and backdoors
- **Phi-3 Integration**: On-device scanning with Microsoft's lightweight SLM for smarter threat detection
- **Layered "Holographic" Shields**: Multi-stage boundary checks inspired by event horizons
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Prototype UI for monitoring scans and simulations (`shield_v2_dashboard.py`)
- **Extensible Prototype**: Core logic in `shield_v2_prototype.py`
- Prep for quantum-inspired defenses (QKD vibes) and semantic threat detection

AI safety doesn't have to be boring—this is defense with style. 🌠
